## NOTE
#### Alexa requires node version 8.2 or less. I suggest using node version manager (nvm) to toggle between versions of node durring development

### Install Node and Git on your windows box. There are installers for node nvm mysql and git. just search google.

#### Send me an email if you want credentials for a database I have set up on the web host to handle the web submission, or install your own database and replance the credentials in the config/config.js file in the api folder.

### Alexa Skill and React UI for creating a study aide for html and css 

### great way to play with many different aspects of full stack development. 
```

web services using express and react
Alexa using lambda, skills kit, dynamodb
html
css
```

##### Open a command prompt and navigate to the api directory. From the command line type
#### npm istall
##### this will install all the dependencies required. When completed type:
#### npm start

##### This will start the web server and you can then navigate to localhost:3000 to display the site. 

##### Open another command prompt and navigate to the api directory. From the command line type
#### npm istall
##### this will install all the dependencies required. When completed type:
#### node app

##### This will run the api server which will take the form values and post them to the webdev table on the mysql database.
